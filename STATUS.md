# STATUS

## Badge

We apply for the **available**, **functional** and **reusable** badge.

## Reasons

We released the compiled binaries that can be easily used to reproduce our experiment results.
In *INSTALL.md*, we provide detailed instructions on how to setup the environment and run the prototype. 
In *README.md*, we clearly describe the data format and demonstrate the usage of data collection script and data analysis scripts.
Further, we provide bash scripts, i.e., auto.sh, to fully automate the data collection, analysis and script isolation process.
The dataset is also available for verification and validation.
In summary, our artifacts are carefully documented and reusable.
